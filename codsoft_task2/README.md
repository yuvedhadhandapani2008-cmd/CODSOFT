# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python where a human player competes against an AI.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves, making it a challenging opponent.  
Players can choose their symbol (X or O) before starting the game.

## Features
- Interactive command-line game
- Player can choose between X or O
- AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal strategy
- Detects wins, losses, and draws
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (or any Python IDE)

## How to Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or any IDE.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program using:
    python tic_tac_toe.py
5. Follow on-screen prompts to choose your symbol and make moves.
6. The game will display the board after every move and announce the result.

## Sample Output
Choose your symbol (X or O): X
